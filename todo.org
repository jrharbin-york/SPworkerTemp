** TODO Ordering; process tests in order!
** TODO for heterogenous - do not pre-allocate more than 1

* Remaining hardcoded items:

The PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME in rosMain.egl - needs to be set from the DSL - get from current expt runner IP
NS_HOSTNAME in PyroDaemons.java - in distributed package - again needs to be set in expt runner

Find the current IP and start the nameserver on the node
Need to start up the nameserver and find the current IP address in Java instead
